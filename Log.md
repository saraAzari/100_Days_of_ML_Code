Day 0: July 28, 2018
 I'm so excited to have started this new challenge on machine learning with my girlfriend.
 We are preparing for the Dangue fever challenge by learning Machine Learning on Kaggle.com

Day 1: July 29, 2018
I learned about data fitting today.

Day 2: July 30, 2018
I have completed level 1 of machine learning. I am god.

Day 3: July 31, 2018
Moving on to level 2. I was a simple angel but after this I WILL be god.
I learned about handling missing values today. It was very interesting to compare the different approaches that can be taken to deal with this issue.

A good analogy would be to consider the following sentence: 
"_ind people who are always there for you".
The first approach is to drop the first word with the missing character. Your sentence becomes "people who are always there for you."
The second approach is to assign a sensible letter to substitute the first letter. Lets say we choose "F"
The third approach is to choose "F" as the first letter but we label that letter, since it could have been another letter, say "K".
